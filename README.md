- 👋 Hi, I’m @AlexanderAkilovTech
- 👀 I’m interested in technology, self-hosting, open-source software, and learning new programming languages and tools. 
     I’m passionate about improving IT infrastructure, virtualized systems, networking, and exploring the latest trends in cybersecurity. 
     I also enjoy working on my homelab, self-hosted AI, and experimenting with various tech setups. Outside of tech, I like reading about science, history, etc.
- 🎓 I hold an Associate's degree in Cybersecurity - Digital Forensics and am currently pursuing my IT (Engineering Technology) bachelor’s degree with a focus on virtualized systems and networking fundamentals.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to make my homelab better for daily use, experimenting with different software and technology. I’m also learning bash scripting and developing my very first FOSS app with three versions:
   1.  A terminal utility for WSL, macOS, and Linux written in Python.
   2.  A GUI version for macOS written in Swift.
   3.  A Docker-Compose version for self-hosting.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on future projects and ideas.
